Smart Device Performance Dashboard
This project involves cleaning, transforming, and analyzing smart home device usage data to generate key performance insights. The data was downloaded from Kaggle and loaded into SQL Server Management Studio for cleaning and transformation, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and adding a new date column with randomly generated values due to missing date data.

The cleaned data was then imported into Tableau to create visualizations and generate key performance indicators (KPIs), including:

Average energy consumption
Device usage hours per day
Device faults
User priority for each device
Energy consumption vs. hours used trends
This dashboard helps analyze the performance of smart devices, track energy usage, identify faults, and provide actionable insights for better energy management.
